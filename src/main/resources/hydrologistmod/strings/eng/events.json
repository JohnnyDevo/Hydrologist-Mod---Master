      "You come across an ornate building which appears strangely familiar. NL You remember this place from what seems like a lifetime ago, a distant memory. NL Inside, you find countless rows of scrolls and books curated by creatures you remember as Knowledge Seekers. NL You pick a book and cozy yourself into a chair for some quiet time.",
